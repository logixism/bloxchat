# BloxChat

BloxChat is a small desktop chat app for ROBLOX built with:

- React + TypeScript (UI)
- Tauri (desktop wrapper)
- Rust (native backend used by Tauri)

## Install (Easy Way)

If you just want to use the app:

1. Download the installer from the latest [release](https://github.com/logixism/bloxchat/releases/latest).
2. Run the installer and open **BloxChat**.

## Use

1. Launch **BloxChat** from your app menu/start menu.
2. Sign in or connect as prompted by the app.
3. Join any ROBLOX game and start chatting! You can press slash like you would in a normal ROBLOX chat, and BloxChat will automatically focus/unfocus itself as needed

If a new version is available, download it from the GitHub **Releases** tab the same way.
